# 🏡 House Price Prediction using California Dataset

A simple machine learning project that predicts median house prices in California using the Linear Regression algorithm and the built-in California housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

## 🧬 About the Project

This project demonstrates how to train and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model to predict housing prices based on various features such as income, house age, and location. It includes:

* Model training
* Performance evaluation using MSE and R² score
* Predicting house prices based on user input

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔢 Uses Scikit-learn's California Housing dataset
* 🔄 Train-test split and evaluation
* 🔠 Predict housing price based on custom user input
* 🏛️ Coefficients insight for each feature

---

## ⚖️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
